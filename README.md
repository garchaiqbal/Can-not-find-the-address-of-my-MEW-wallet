Can not find the address of my MEW wallet

Hello,

3 months ago i created a wallet with by Mnemonic Phrase on myetherwallet.com
I saved the 12 words on a paper as well as the password. I could access my wallet without any problem by Mnemonic Phrase, since I saw my address genere.
Now I can not find the address generated on MyEtherWallet yet before it worked without any problem. But now, there are so many other addresses are showing without my balance address.
What should I do to find the address of my wallet? What is the problem? I'm panicked because I have 2000 dollars in this wallet.
I already contacted to support team, they advised me to use third party softwares, beacuse they cannot do anything to find my exact address.
I also used Metamask for the backup of my addresss, but it is also picking wrong address.
I also used MEW Wallet app, but it is also picking same wrong address.
plz help me.
